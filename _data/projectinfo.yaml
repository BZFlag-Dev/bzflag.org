  short_description: An old map editor for BZFlag 1.7 world format.
  description: |
    BZEditW32 is an old map editor created for editing BZFlag worlds. It only
    map features that existed in BZFlag 1.7, so it is lacking support for mesh
    objects, options block, groups, and any other features added since 1.7.
