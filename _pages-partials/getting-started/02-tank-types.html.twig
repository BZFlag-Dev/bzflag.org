        <p>
            The game has four main teams: Red, Green, Blue, and Purple. In the Free For All and Capture The Flag game modes, each of those teams work together to fight the other teams. Teammates should not shoot each other in those modes. In the Open Free For All game mode, the teams do not matter and it is allowed to shoot any tank for points.

        <p>
            Servers can choose to limit the number of players per team or disable a team entirely.

                    Like the feeling of having no loyalties to anyone? You consider yourself a lone wolf or aloof? The rogue class lets you play as a tank who's abandoned all its ties to any team and can shoot any tank, even other rogues.
