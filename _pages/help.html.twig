    <h2>Web Forums</h2>

    <p>
      BZFlag hosts a <a href="http://forums.bzflag.org/">forum</a> for registered users. This also serves as a <a href="http://wiki.bzflag.org/Global_Registration">player registration system</a> for the game.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Support Issues</h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://wiki.bzflag.org/Common_Support_Issues">Common Support Issues</a> page lists a number of the common problems with the game, and their resolutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>
      The game is documented via a series of manual pages (or man pages).
    </p>

    <p>
      On Microsoft Windows the manual pages are in HTML format, and are available from the start menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, they are installed by default and can be accessed by using the man command and one of the following pages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>bzflag</li>
      <li>bzfs</li>
      <li>bzadmin</li>
      <li>bzw</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Further Support</h2>

    <p>
      If none of these methods provide a resolution to your problem, the project maintains a <a href="https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag/issues">issue tracker on GitHub</a> where an issue can be opened.
