    ## Plug-in API

    ### Plug-in Events

    API events are BZFS callbacks that plug-ins can listen for in response to specific actions or changes in the state of the server. Events exist for nearly all actions that occur during a game of BZFlag.

    {% for event in collections.api_events -%}
    - [{{ event.basename }}]({{ url(this.permalink ~ 'bzfs_api/' ~ (event.basename | lower)) }})
    {% endfor %}
    {% endmarkdown %}
