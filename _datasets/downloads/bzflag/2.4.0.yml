    * The ability to turn off teamkilling on the server
    * The OpenFFA game mode which is a teamless FFA, meaning you can shoot anyone regardless of color
    * Per-object ricochet, which lets map authors selectively enable ricochet for individual objects
    * Removal of local authentication
    * Ability for the server to force flags to be hidden on the radar
    * Fog can not be turned off
    * The screenshot code does not lag the client badly anymore
    * The ID flag identification was moved to the server
    * Public servers must have a -publickey
    * Polls only count users that are able to vote
