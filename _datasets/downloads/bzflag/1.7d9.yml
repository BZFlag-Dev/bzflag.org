version: 1.7d9
changelog: |
    * fixed bug in parsing arguments in bzfls

    * made bzfls more picky about format of messages
    * added uptime to bzfls statistics
    * changed bzfls protocol and bzfs to match; deliberately not backwards compatible to force upgrades
    * gave flag help messages more space to avoid overlapping target box
    * added sym link for bzfs in RPM spec file; can't launch server from client without it
    * changed RPM naming scheme to be more standard (now named 1.7d.7)
    * fixes for solaris compiler

    * fixed busy wait bug in linux sound code
    * incremented number of sound chunks on linux and fixed low water mark
    * reduced sound latency on linux
    * doubled sound volume
    * fixes for linux resolution changes (now destroys/recreates OpenGL contexts)
    * workaround for accelerated glx preventing screen redraw after exit
    * added -3dfx and -no3dfx bzflag options to set/unset MESA_GLX_FX
    * now allows user to configure a non-optimized build (e.g. make linux-noopt)
    * added tarball make target to gather source tree into a tarball
    * modified spec file for RPM packaging - Tim Riker
    * more sound fixes
      * now always writes sound even when silent (which simplifies things)
      * now handles failure of SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT
      * BZF_NOAUDIO_POST env var disables latency workaround when SETFRAGMENT fails
      * fixed bug that caused some truncated chunks
    * video format menu now uses multiple pages if lots of formats
    * now ungrabs mouse on pause and grabs on resume (if grabbing)
    * players now drop a team flag when pausing (prevents a cheat)
    * made some readouts more readable at low resolution (changed font)
    * changes to bzfs to make it more robust against network errors
    * fixed bzfs messages to bzfls (was only ever sending ADD messages)
    * bzfls now keeps traffic statistics (SIGUSR2 dumps to /var/tmp/bzfls.cnt)
    * added man pages for bzfls and bzfrelay
    * now allows user to configure a debug build (e.g. make linux-i386-debug)
    * cleaned up some compiler warnings
    * fixed silliness in PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR stuff in win32
    * fixed multicasting support
    * fixed sound volume bug (reset to zero in config if quit when paused)
    * fixed handling of window close under X windows
    * fixed several serious bugs in sound filtering
      * coordinate system was totally wrong
      * various calculations were incorrect
    * improved sound support on linux and got sound working on linux ppc
    * improved stereo panning filtering; new transfer function does better directional attenuation
    * added inter-aural delay to enhance stereo separation
    * added support for brightness control (i.e. gamma correction)
      * only available on PseudoColor or DirectColor visuals under X
      * only available on win32 if using colormap or SetDeviceGammaRamp() works
    * added custom visual choosing algorithm on X (to prefer DirectColor over True) making it more likely to get a gamma correctable visual
    * added support for destroying/recreating OpenGL context on-the-fly; required to support dynamic video format changing on win32
    * support for dynamic changing of video format on xfree86 and win32; removed startup format picker on win32 -- change format through options
    * improved integration with win32 desktop (alt-tab, screen saver, etc.); minimizes on loss of focus;  disables annoying key sequences
