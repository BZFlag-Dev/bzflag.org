changesummary: |
    This release just had some more minor fixes

    - Increase the range of the volume slider (which I think means the volume slider has a more noticeable effect now)
    - Send a notification when a BZDB variable is reset
    - Add an indicator to the server list when a server has team killing disabled
    - Reduce CPU usage on Windows when the client is minimized (like how it used to be prior to 2.4.6)
    - Added a Russian transliteration of the translation we had in 2.99.x
