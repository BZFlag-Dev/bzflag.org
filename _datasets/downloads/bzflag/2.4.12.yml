version: 2.4.12
codename: 'Silence is Golden'
changesummary: |
    This release had a few additional features and some minor fixes.

    - Multisampling (anti-aliasing) now works on all platforms with SDL
    - The permission for running **/poll set** is no longer assigned by default
    - The macOS build uses a newly released version of SDL that fixes an issue with retina macs when running in a scaled resolution
    - It is possible to silence all unregistered players in your client by silencing `-` (the minus sign or hyphen), similar to how silencing `*` (asterisk) silences all players. Additionally, the **/silence** and **/unsilence** commands both work correctly now and support both special cases.
