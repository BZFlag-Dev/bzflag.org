The bz_eFlagQuality is used to define what type custom flags will be by default. The quality determines how the flag behaves when the player is holding it.

eGoodFlag behaves like a regular flag that can be grabbed and dropped. A bad flag becomes "sticky" on a tank and will remain on it until the bad flag conditions apply (such as killing X number of players or waiting X number of seconds) or will be stuck on the tank until death / pausing.
