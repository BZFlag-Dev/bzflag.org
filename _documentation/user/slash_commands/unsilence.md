The unsilence command works like the silence command, except it removes an existing entry from the silence list.

An alternate way to silence or unsilence is to use the 'k' key, which brings up a prompt at the bottom of the screen. This accepts a callsign, asterisk, or minus sign, and automatically handles adding or removing the entry depending on if it already exists.
