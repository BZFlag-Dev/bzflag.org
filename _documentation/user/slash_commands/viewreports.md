Some servers are configured to allow reports. Players can leave reports with the /report command. Admins may be able to view these reports. Some of these reports may require the server owner's help in tracking down a problem, but there are times when an admin/cop can handle an issue. By using the /viewreports command, an admin can view all the reports that have been left on the server.

**NOTE:** The server owner will have to be the one to manually clear out old reports. There is no integrated mechanism to clear them out, so it needs direct file-system access. This should be done periodically.
