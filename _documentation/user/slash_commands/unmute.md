The unmute command will remove the mute from a player. To use the unmute command, provide the username or player slot.

For example, using the following command:

```
/mute SomePlayer
```

would show this to the admin:

```
[SERVER->] player id #0 "SomePlayer" is now unmuted.
```

and this to SomePlayer:

```
[SERVER->] You have been unmuted by BobTheTank.
```
