The help command, when used alone, will show a list of available help pages. For example, running `/help` may show something like the following:

```
[SERVER->] Available help pages (use /help <page>)
[SERVER->] rules
[SERVER->] tips
```

In the above example, two pages are available. Here is what the output of `/help rules` may look like:

```
[SERVER->] Help: Rules
[SERVER->] ---
[SERVER->] Please be nice to everyone. Do not swear, cheat, or kill teammates.
[SERVER->] The admins have the right to mute, kick and ban those who do not follow the above rules.
```
