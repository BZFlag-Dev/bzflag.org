The idlestats command will show how long a player has been idle. "Idle" is defined as being dead or paused. It will specifically show if someone is paused, and how long they have been paused.

Example output:

```
[SERVER->] SomePlayer : 0s
[SERVER->] Six Feet Under : 16s
[SERVER->] BobTheTank : 13s paused 13s
```
