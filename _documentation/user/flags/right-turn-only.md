The Right Turn Only (RT) flag causes increased difficulty in dodging, as left turns are no longer possible and due to this, many tactics in avoiding shots are rendered ineffective.

## Tactics

Right Turn Only requires one to avoid areas where one may get stuck or where shots are difficult to dodge. Examples include, but are not limited to: narrow passageways or corridors, areas where shots have complicated or difficult to dodge ricochets, along with map corners.
