The Shock Wave (SW) flag fires a spherical blast originating from the center of the tank, destroying **any** tank inside (other than the one who fired it). It penetrates solid objects, but is not affected by teleporters (meaning, it will not travel through to the linked teleporter).

## Tactics

Due to the short range of the weapon, getting close to the opponent is a must. It can, however, kill players above or below, so this can be used to kill enemies that are at a different elevation. A common strategy is to avoid firing until close so that an enemy isn't aware of the threat until it is too late.

Shock Wave can kill [burrowed](../burrow/) tanks, tanks that have entered buildings using [Oscillation Overthruster](../oscillation-overthruster/), or [Phantom Zone](../phantom-zone/) tanks that have passed into the other dimension. It's also very good at killing teammate, so watch out for friendly fire.
