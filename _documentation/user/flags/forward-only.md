The Forward Only (FO) flag prevents backwards movement and makes it harder to dodge and generally reduces efficiency in movement.

## Tactics

Forward Only requires good map knowledge and being able to avoid areas and tactics where backwards movement may be required. This includes, but is not limited to: firing shots and backing up to take cover, areas where backing up is more efficient than a turn, or places where one might get stuck, such as corners or walls and areas where shots are difficult to predict or dodge. Being aware of the location of enemy players is a highly important factor, as one of the main dangers are enemy tanks which approach from the rear since it is difficult out-maneuver them at close range.
