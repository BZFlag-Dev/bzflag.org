The Forward Only flag prevents backwards movement and makes it harder to dodge and generally reduces efficiency in movement.

## Tactics

Forward Only requires good map knowledge and being able to avoid areas and tactics where backwards moment may be required. This includes, but is not limited to: Firing shots and backing up to take cover, areas where backing up is more efficient than a turn and takes far less time or places where one might get stuck, such as corners or walls and areas where shots are difficult to predict or dodge. Being aware of the location of enemy players is highly important factor, as one of the main dangers are enemy tanks which approach from the rear, as it is virtually impossible to out-maneuver them at close range.
