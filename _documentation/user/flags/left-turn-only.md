The Left Turn Only flag causes increased difficulty in dodging, as right turns are no longer possible and due to this, many tactics in avoiding shots are rendered ineffective.

## Tactics

Left Turn Only requires one to avoid areas where one may get stuck or where shots are difficult to dodge. Examples include, but are not limited to: narrow passageways or corridors, areas where shots have complicated or difficult to dodge ricochets along with map corners.
