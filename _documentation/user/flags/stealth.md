Stealth flag allows the player to be invisible to other players on the radar.

## Potency

The only way to locate a player with a Stealth flag is to either see them on a screen, see their shots, hear them jump around, or nullify their flag's effect through the use of the [Seer](../seer/)</a> flag.

With the ability of locating and tracking the movement of tanks on radar being really powerful and commonly utilized, especially among the more experienced players, the Stealth flag is considered to be very powerful regardless of the map. However, the more crowded the map is with objects, the higher the potency of the flag is, as it becomes easier for the holder to hide and plan a surprise attack.

As Stealth does not allow the opponent to prepare for a potential interaction due to not being able to even approximately position the holder on the map via radar, it is considered to be *the* most powerful flag in the game by some.

## Usage

While being able to prevent the opponent from locating the holder is a lot in itself, the actual usefulness of the flag comes from the tactics used while in pursuit. To increase the odds of successful assassination, the holder should hide from the opponent while moving closer, only attempting to shoot when in close proximity, in order to restrict the opponent from performing any reactions that could save them.

A holder of the Stealth flag should jump as least as possible to stay quiet, as well as always look at where the opponent is facing and where they are moving, so they can position themselves accordingly. Planning the route of the opponent is one of the essential factors, as driving to a foreseen point of intersection and awaiting the opponent behind an object before swiftly killing them is one of the most common and effective methods of Stealth assassinations.
