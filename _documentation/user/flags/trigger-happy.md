The Trigger Happy (TR) flag causes all of a tank's shots to be fired as fast as they are reloaded, leaving a tank without any ammo.

## Tactics 

Trigger Happy requires appropriate timing as well as being able to accurately aim shots to counter its effects. Due to all shots being fired immediately, tanks have little control of where to aim the shots being fired. This can accidentally lead to team kills or ricochets causing self-kills.
