summary: Very fast reload and very short range.
---

The Machine Gun (MG) flag fires all of a tank's ammo together and grants a really fast reload rate. By default, the distance these bullets can travel is significantly shorter than regular shots making it useful only in close-range combat.

The speed and distance of the shots fired by this flag vary significantly from server to server. On some servers, machine gun bullets will travel faster and further, making it suitable for mid- to long-range combat.

## Tactics

Since the range of the Machine Gun flag varies from server to server, it's a good idea to determine the range of the flag when you grab it for the first time. Use the Machine Gun flag with caution in tight or enclosed spaces because there's a high likelihood of shooting yourself or a teammate with a ricochet.

Taking advantage of the fast reload time gives you the luxury of being able to shoot more often without having to worry about being left without ammo. Tanks shooting while turning will be able to fire shots in a very tight spread making it harder for enemies to dodge.

Since this flag shoots more than one shot at a time, it proves to be affective against the [Shield flag](../shield/) where one shot disables the shield and the other gets the kill. The ability to shoot multiple tanks perfectly lined up is also a possibility since only one of the multiple shots will stop as it hits a tank but the others may continue.
