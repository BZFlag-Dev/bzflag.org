Tanks with the Bouncy flag jump automatically until the flag is dropped. As Bouncy automatically causes a tank to jump, it makes landings, movement and direction mostly uncontrolled and makes one an easier target.

## Tactics

Bouncy require fine and precise control movements to counter its effects. By doing this one can turn and adjust their jump path, turning rate and be able to control their tanks general direction and path, allowing one to retain a lot of control over their tank. The jumps of the Bouncy vary between one forth to the max height of regular jump and jumps are triggered roughly one fifth of a second after landing. There is a possibility of triggering jumps manually, but the timing must be perfect and the jump height will vary as well. The main danger with Bouncy is the constant jumps which allow enemy tanks to fire shots towards the landing path, possibly causing one to land into their shots. The same applies in reverse to tanks which are a single jump distance in height above them.  As firing above into their jumping path, a Bouncy tank may jump directly into shots fired above them.
