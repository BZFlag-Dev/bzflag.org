The Bouncy (BY) flag causes tanks to jump automatically until the flag is dropped. As Bouncy automatically causes a tank to jump, it makes landings, movement, and direction mostly uncontrollable and makes one an easier target.

## Tactics

Bouncy requires fine and precise movements to counter its effects. By doing this, one can turn and adjust their jump path and turning rate to be able to control their tank's general direction and path, allowing one to retain a lot of control over their tank. The jumps of the Bouncy flag vary between one forth to the max height of a regular jump. These jumps are triggered roughly one fifth of a second after landing. There is a possibility of triggering jumps manually, but the timing must be perfect and the jump height will vary as well. The main danger with Bouncy is the constant jumps, which allow enemy tanks to fire shots towards the landing path, possibly causing one to land into their shots. The same applies in reverse to tanks which are a single jump distance in height above them. As firing above into their jumping path, a Bouncy tank may jump directly into shots fired above them.
