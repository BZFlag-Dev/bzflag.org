The Phantom Zone (PZ) flag allows the player to enter the Zoned state when passing through a teleporter. Exceptionally, passing through such a teleporter while holding the flag does not trigger an actual positioning teleport regardless of link settings, only applying the Zoned effect. Passing through a teleporter while Zoned reverts the tank back to its original state.

Zoned tanks can drive through buildings, but unlike tanks with the [Oscillation Overthruster](../oscillation-overthruster/) flag, Zoned tanks can also drive backwards and shoot while inside buildings.

Whiled Zoned, the tank shoots Zoned bullets. Such bullets are only capable of killing other Zoned tanks. On the other hand, Zoned tanks can also be killed by tanks holding [Super Bullet](../super-bullet/) or [Shock Wave](../shock-wave/) flags.

## Tactics

Phantom Zone can be utilized as a means of quick navigation or for escaping purposes. The former is viable when attempting to directly reach a certain destination, such as the opponent's team flag, a zone filled with desirable flags, or a viable battle position. The latter can be considered at the rabbit hunt game mode to escape as a rabbit for an extended period of time.
