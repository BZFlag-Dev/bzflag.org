The ReverseControls (RC) flag causes the input of the controls to be reversed; forwards is backwards, left is right, right is left, etc. Moving around and dodging shots becomes difficult.

## Tactics

The ReverseControls flag requires the ability to be able to adjust and adapt quickly to counter its effects. If one is able to achieve that change, the effects of ReverseControls may be reduced.
