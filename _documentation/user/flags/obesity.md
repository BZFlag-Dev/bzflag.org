The Obesity flag increases the size of the tank and makes dodging shots much harder due to the increased size.

## Tactics

As the tank is much larger, it becomes an easier target and movement in tight places is more difficult. Avoiding shots requires earlier reaction time and in maps where jumping is enabled, the timing of jumps is different due to the size of the tank, so one may have to jump earlier or later to jump onto platforms and objects. 

## Server Settings
* **_obeseFactor** affects the size of the tank by a multiple of normal tank size settings.
