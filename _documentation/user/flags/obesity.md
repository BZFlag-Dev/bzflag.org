The Obesity (O) flag increases the size of the tank and makes dodging shots much harder due to the increased size.

## Tactics

As the tank is much larger, it becomes an easier target since avoiding shots requires earlier reaction time and greater movement. Due to an increased size, movement in tight places is more difficult.

## Server Settings

- `_obeseFactor` - affects the size of the tank by a multiple of normal tank size settings.
