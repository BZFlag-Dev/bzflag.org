The Wide Angle (WA) flag causes a tank's viewing perspective from the outside window to increase dramatically, distorting the outside view. This causes it to become difficult to judge distances and location correctly.

## Tactics

Wide Angle requires fine control or good radar skills, as either being able to aim precisely or using the radar for lining up shots will allow one to aim effectively. It will be more difficult to judge the location and speed of bullets which appear on the outside window view possibly causing one to incorrectly estimate their location, speed, and heading. The main counter to the effects of Wide Angle is the use of the radar, as radar is unaffected by this flag; the only minor change will be the indication of view of field. One is recommended to take advantage of a wider field of view, which may allow one to spot danger quicker, but should know that reaching safety can be more difficult.
