The Wide Angle flag causes a tanks viewing perspective from the outside window to increase dramatically, distorting the outside view as well and causes it to become difficult to judge distances and location correctly.

## Tactics

Wide Angle requires fine control or good radar skills, as either being able to aim precisely or using the radar for lining up shots will allow one to aim effectively, the same applies to dodging shots as well. Bullets which appear on the outside window view will be much more difficult to judge their precise location and speed and one may incorrectly estimate their location, speed, and heading. The main counter to the effects of Wide Angle is the use of the radar, as radar is unaffected by the Wide Angle flag; the only minor change will be the indication of view of field. One is recommended to try to take advantage that a wider field of view may allow one to spot danger quicker, but should know that reaching safety will be more difficult.
