The ReverseOnly (RO) flag prevents driving forward and increases difficulties in avoiding shots.

## Tactics 

As backward movement is slower, one must react earlier since shots will still approach at a regular speed, but the speed at which one will be able to dodge them is reduced. Additionally, areas where one is not able to turn well should be avoided, especially if ricochet is enabled on the map.
