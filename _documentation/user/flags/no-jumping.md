The No Jumping (NJ) flag disables jumping and causes one to be unable to jump.

## Tactics

No Jumping requires good dodging skills to counter its effects. The main risk to No Jumping is the lack of being able to jump away from shots or danger. By using one's radar, one can accurately determine where shots are and avoid them, including ones which are beyond one's field of view from the outside window. This, however, does not apply to [invisible bullets](../invisible-bullet/), which can only be sighted by the outside window or with [Seer (SE)](../seer/). One should avoid falling into a false sense of security when relying on one's radar to predict where shots will be, as [super bullets](../super-bullet/) go through objects and do not ricochet. One should definitely take into account flags held by other players.
