## Tactics

No Jumping requires good dodging skills to counter its effects. The main risk to No Jumping is the lack of being able to jump away from shots or danger. The majority of shots can be dodged by simple movement and prediction. By using one's radar, allows one to accurately determine where shots are and avoid them, including ones which are beyond one's field of view from the outside window, this however does not apply to [invisible bullet](../invisible-bullet/) which can only be sighted by the outside window or with [seer)](../seer/). One should avoid falling into a false sense of security when relying on one's radar to predict where shots will be, as [super bullets](../super-bullet/) go through objects and do not ricochet, so one should take into account flags held by players.
