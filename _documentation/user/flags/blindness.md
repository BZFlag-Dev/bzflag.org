The Blindness (B) flag blocks sight of the map, tanks, and shots from the outside window viewing perspective. By being blind to outside surroundings and unable to sight tanks, shots, or view the landscape of the map, one becomes an easy target.

## Tactics

Blindness requires one to use the radar for aiming and avoiding shots in order to counter its effects. By using the radar, one can move, dodge, and avoid most obstacles, except for the ones which do not appear on radar. The main flags which a player having Blindness should be specifically aware of, are [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/) and [Invisible Bullet (IB)](../invisible-bullet/). Stealthed tanks give away their last position if they fire any shots and tanks with Invisible Bullet can be hunted in order to allow one to take cover to avoid encountering them. One should take special caution in maps where the radar is disabled or the max radar range is limited to short ranges.
