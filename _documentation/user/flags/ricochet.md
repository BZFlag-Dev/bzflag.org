The Ricochet (R) flag allows the player to fire shots that can bounce off of the objects they hit. An exception are objects with the attributes `shootthrough` or `passable`, where the result is the bullet passing through the object.

The Ricochet flag has no value on maps that enable ricochet. For maps where ricochet is not enabled, the Ricochet flag offers the holder the advantage of banking shots.

## Tactics

Ricochet is potent on maps filled with objects behind which a tank can hide from direct enemy fire, while attempting to shoot the opponent by bouncing shots off objects.

Effective use of the Ricochet flag requires accurate estimation of the path of a shot after it bounces off an obstacle. Multiple bounces compounds the difficulty. One may observe the trajectory of a shot and adjust the point of aim to increase accuracy.
