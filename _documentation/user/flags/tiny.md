The Tiny (T) flag allows the player to be smaller in tank size than normal, all while retaining all other properties, such as the tank speed, shot speed, or jump height.

It is configured by the `_tinyFactor` server setting, which is multiplied by the normal tank size to get shrunken `_tankLength` and `_tankWidth` values for the tank holding the flag.

## Tactics

Tiny can be utilized as a means of easier bullet evasion. Since the tank is smaller than normal, it can slip through bullet spreads that a tank of normal size could not. The closer to zero the `_tinyFactor` is set, the harder it is to hit.

It can also serve as a navigation utility, helping the player pass through small openings, should the map have them.
