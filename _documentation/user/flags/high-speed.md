summary: Tank moves faster. Outrun bad guys.

The High Speed (V) flag allows a tank to drive at a faster speed than other tanks indefinitely. Unlike the [Agility (A)]({{ url(collections.flags['agility']) }}) flag, which only provides speed bursts on initial acceleration, High Speed is a consistent modifier in driving speed.

## Tactics

With an increased speed, tanks holding the flag can outrun their opponents when they're in sticky situations; incredibly useful when trying to outrun [Guided Missles (GM)]({{ url(collections.flags['guided-missile']) }}) and [Shock Waves (SW)]({{ url(collections.flags['shock-wave']) }}).

Bullet speeds are relative to a tank's forward movement, meaning the faster a tank is moving forward, the faster their bullets will be allowing tanks to catch their prey off-guard.
