The Invisible Bullet (IB) flag will hide a tank's shots from being visible on other players' radars. This flag's effect can be nullified by any tank holding the [Masquerade](../masquerade/) flag.

## Tactics

Relying on one's radar is crucial to detecting shots coming from anywhere not visible through a tank's window. Unless an enemy tank is carrying the [Masquerade](../masquerade/) flag, invisible bullets will not appear on their radar allowing you to catch these tanks off guard. While holding this flag, you may appear to be harmless on a radar as your enemies may think they're not under fire. Similar to being stealthed, it's a good idea to kill enemies from their blindspots quickly before they realize they're under fire and have time to react. Taking advantage of ricochets from your surroundings is a good way to get invisible bullets into an enemy's blindspot.

Your own bullets will still be visible on your tank's radar to allow you to dodge any stray ricohets. However, this flag will hide your shots from teammates too, so be careful not to shoot your own teammates!
