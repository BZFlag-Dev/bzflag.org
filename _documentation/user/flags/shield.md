---

The Shield (SH) flag absorbs a single shot, protecting the holder of the flag. After being shot, the flag drops. If the flag isn't ready to respawn in a new location, it will fly up higher than normal flags before landing on the ground again.

Note that the Shield flag does **not** protect against a teammate that is shot with [Genocide](../genocide/).
