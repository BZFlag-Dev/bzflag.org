The Steamroller (SR) flag allows the player to kill tanks that get within a certain proximity of the holder; this proximity varies amongst maps.

## Tactics

Steamroller has a relatively straightforward effect, but its usefulness can vary depending on how far the squishing of opponents can reach, which is declared through the `_srRadiusMult` server variable.

Having a low radius of effect will make the flag commonly reach the levels of uselessness, especially when in a battle of shooting tanks. Having a high radius, will make direct 1-on-1 battles much more successful, as tanks will approach each other and when close enough will result in them getting steamrolled.

The effect of the high radius also comes useful when attempting to kill opponents with the [Burrow (BU)](../burrow/) or [Wings (WG)](../wings/) flags, as the range of reach can increase, killing such opponents sooner than normally possible.

### Caution

High radius or sudden grabs of the Steamroller flag while in the proximity of teammates can result in unwanted teamkills, unless the server is configured to disallow team kills.
