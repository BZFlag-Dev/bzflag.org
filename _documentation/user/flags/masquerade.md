The Masquerade (MQ) flag will camouflage your tank to appear as a teammate in other tanks' windows but you will still appear as an enemy on their radar and your shots will not be camouflaged. This flag's effects can be nullified by the [Seer flag](../seer/).

## Tactics

Your tank will appear as a teammate in other tanks' windows, however, your shots are not camouflaged. It's recommended to save your shots to prevent giving away your identity if you're attempting to fool an enemy; only shoot once you're confident you'll be able to get a kill.

On maps where radar is disabled, this flag is especially useful in fooling your enemies as they can't verify your real identity unless you give it away by firing. Players who are not accustomed to using their radar will also be easy to fool if they rely solely on what they see through their window.

There are two ways to counter the effects of this flag:

1. Carrying the [Seer](../seer/) flag, which nullifies this ability
2. Checking the radar to determine the team of what may be an enemy tank

This flag is useless for rogue tanks and in the Open FFA game mode as teammates do not exist.
