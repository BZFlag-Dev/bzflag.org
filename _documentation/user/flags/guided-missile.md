The Guided Missile (GM) flag provides a locking system and changes the shot type to a missile. Using the lock/identify key when looking at another player will lock onto that tank. Any active or fired missiles will attempt to seek to the targeted tank. The lock target can be set before or after firing and can be changed.

## Tactics

Due to GM being a powerful flag, the holder tends to be targeted by other players quickly. Given that it is possible to target players above and below, a common strategy is to move to higher ground so that enemies must come to you. Also note that the missiles, by default, are not lethal for half a second after firing, so they will not kill at close range.

To counter the GM, the [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/) flag can be used. A GM cannot lock onto a player that has a Stealth flag. Note that if a player with GM locked on to a player before they grabbed ST, the lock may remain.

Another counter is possible on servers with default settings for tank and shot speeds. The guided missile moves slightly slower than normal shots and has a limiting turning speed. This allows for dodging guided missiles by moving almost perpendicular to the player with GM. Circling slowly towards the player will force them to either fire unguided missiles, drop their flag, or run. As mentioned earlier, at a close enough range, the missiles will not be lethal and you can go in for the kill.
