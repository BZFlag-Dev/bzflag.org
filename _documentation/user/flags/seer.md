The Seer (SE) flag allows the player to see through tanks camouflaging themselves or their shots either from in the window or radar of other players. This flag nullifies the effects of the following flags for the beholder:

- [Cloaking (CL)](../cloaking/)
- [Invisible Bullet (IB)](../invisible-bullet/)
- [Masquerade (MQ)](../masquerade/)
- [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/)

## Tactics

Unlike most other good flags, Seer does not add any effect when battling against tanks that have non-camouflaging flags. As this flag disables the effect of other specific flags for the holder, the usage of Seer is highly situational.

The Seer flag can be extremely useful when used on a map where most tanks carry the [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/) flag as it would give the holder an advantage of knowing where all the stealthed enemies are located. Using the Seer flag is also beneficial when there are stealthed tanks camping in your team's base or when a pesky rabbit starts hiding in a Rabbit Hunt game mode. While holding the Seer flag, it is also common to communicate with your teammates and direct them in the direction of stealthed tanks.
