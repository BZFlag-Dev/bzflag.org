The Seer (SE) flag allows the player to see the tanks holding the [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/), [Cloaking (CL)](../cloaking/), or [Masquerade (MQ)](../masquerade/) flags as normal.

Its power is therefore to nullify the effects of those three flags for the holder, rather than bringing out a unique power-up itself.

## Tactics

As the flag disables the effect of three other specific flags for the holder, the usage of Seer is highly situational.

In general, a player would prefer a flag that gives a power-up itself rather than nullify that of some others, as a power-up can effect most players on the map, while Seer does not add any effect when battling against tanks that have flags other than the three affected by Seer.

As such, the usage is usually limited to the situations where either a holder of one of the three affected flags is in close proximity to the player holding Seer, or the majority of the tanks on the map are holding one of the three affected flags.
