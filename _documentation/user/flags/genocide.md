The Genocide (G) flag fires a special shot that will kill all of the teammates of the tank that was shot; all of the enemy team's deaths are attributed to the holder of the Genocide flag.

## Tactics

Due to its power, it's common for Genocide flags to have a limited number of shots so it's wise to refrain from shooting unnecessarily to avoid wasting any shots. Tanks who are falling without the [Wings flag](../wings/) flag are helpless targets as they cannot avoid landing on well timed Genocide shots.

The only way to defend against Genocide is to dodge the bullets or to use the [Shield (SH)](../shield/) flag to avoid the affects. However, if a teammate is shot with Genocide, there is no way to negate the affect of the flag.
