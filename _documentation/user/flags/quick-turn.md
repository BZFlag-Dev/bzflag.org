The Quick Turn (QT) flag increases the turning speed of the player.

## Tactics

Controlling the tank with this flag is slightly more difficult, but it does allow turning around faster. A useful tactic is encouraging another player to jump down behind you or next to you by acting oblivious to them and then turning around quickly to shoot them as they drop.
