The Colorblindness flag causes teammates and enemies to look exactly alike by causing them to appear as rogue players. The identify/lock-on feature, by using right mouse click or pressing the `i` key to identify players or lock on [guided missiles](../guided-missile/), displays a generic 'Looking at a tank' message.

## Tactics

Colorblindness requires good communication with teammates to know their positions to avoid shooting them by mistake. The main difficulties are that positions may quickly become outdated and [Stealth (ST)](../stealth/) may increase the risk of mistakenly shooting a teammate. Another recommendation is to view the radar frequently, especially before grabbing a flag, as it allows one to have a general idea of the location and position of teammates and enemies.
