summary: Can drive through buildings. Can't back up or shoot while inside.
---

The Oscillation Overthruster (OO) flag allows the player to drive through buildings. While inside a building, the tank can move forward and rotate, but it cannot move backward, jump, or shoot.

Likewise, the tank can only enter buildings while driving forward, not backward. An exception is when the tank hits the building while in the air; at such time, the tank will always pass through or into the building.

## Tactics

Oscillation Overthruster can be utilized as a traveling assist, defensively, or offensively.

As a traveling assist, it can contribute towards reaching a desired destination quickly, by allowing the player to move directly towards it, ignoring any obstacles along the way.

Defensively, it can be used as a means of escaping from an opponent's pursuit. Once inside a building, the holder can reorganize their direction of view, either choosing to take the opponent on with better odds of success, or escaping further.

Offensively, it can allow the holder to perform various 'hit-and-run' actions, where the holder leaves the building to shoot at the opponent and drive back into the building for safety, preventing the opponent from retaliating. Since the holder can also enter buildings backwards if hitting them while in the air, a common strategy is to jump backwards while escaping back into the building, wasting no time on potential turn maneuvering.

## Caution

Escaping into the building does not always guarantee safety. Beware of flags that disregard obstacles.

Tanks holding [Super Bullet](../super-bullet/) can shoot through buildings, which becomes especially dangerous due to tanks being unable to jump while inside buildings. [Shock Wave](../shock-wave/) and [Steamroller](../steamroller/) are dangerous on relatively close proximity, allowing them to defeat the tanks inside buildings if they are inside their range.
