The Super Bullet (SB) flag allows the player to fire shots that pass through objects, keeping their initial direction unchanged. An exception is such shots hitting teleporters, at which point they are teleported through them.

Tanks holding the flag are also capable of killing Zoned opponents possessing the [Phantom Zone](../phantom-zone/) flag.

## Tactics

Super Bullet can be utilized as a means of defeating opponents that are on the map's same height level. It is potent on maps or in map sections with many objects, as the opponent is forced to navigate through said objects in order to target the holder, while the latter can directly target the former.

The holder can combat opponents hiding inside drivethrough or one-way passing objects from a safe distance.

It is an offensive flag that mainly relies on the use of radar. Since the holder can hide behind objects, the radar becomes the prime source of vision.
