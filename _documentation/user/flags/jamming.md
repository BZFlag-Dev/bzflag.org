The Jamming (JM) flag prevents any effective usage of radar, as it fills the radar with static. The lack of awareness of the position of players, shots, and objects which do not appear in the outside window leave tanks in a vulnerable state.

## Tactics

Jamming requires use of the outside window to counter its effects. [Cloaking (CL)](../cloaking/) poses one of the largest dangers to Jamming, as it is invisible in the outside window by default. However, cloaked tanks leave tracks on the ground like any other tank, so it may be possible to spot them and to know its position. This tactic only applies if the cloaked tank has moved recently and if not properly identified with the `i` key or right mouse click to identify players, a teammate may be mistakenly shot. As for shots, one is only be able to see shots coming from the outside window, so avoiding areas where shots may ricochet into or be directed towards one's blind spot is recommended. Checking the sides of one's field of view may allow one to spot enemy tanks approaching from the sides, but one may miss other tanks approaching from another angle due to this.
