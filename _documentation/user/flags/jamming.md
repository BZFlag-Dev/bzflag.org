The Jamming flag prevents any effective usage of radar, as it fills the radar with static and the lack of awareness of the position of players, shots, and objects which do not appear in the outside window is the main danger and risk to it.

## Tactics

Jamming requires use of the outside window to counter effects . [Cloaking (CL)](../cloaking/) poses one of the largest dangers to Jamming, as it is invisible in the outside window, by default however, it leaves tracks on the ground like any other tank, so it may be possible to spot them and to know its position, however, this only applies if the cloaked tank has moved recently and if not properly identified with the 'i' key or right mouse click to identify players, a teammate may be mistakenly shot and this setting may not be enabled on the map. As for shots, one is only be able to see shots coming from the outside window, so avoiding areas where shots may ricochet into or be directed towards ones blind spot is recommended. Checking the sides of ones field of view may allow on to spot enemy tanks approaching from the sides, but one may miss other tanks approaching from the other end due to this.
