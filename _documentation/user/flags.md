There are two types of flags in BZFlag: team flags and super flags. Team flags only show up in the Capture The Flag game mode.

Super flags come in both a good and bad variety. Servers can choose to include specific flags, and many do not include any bad flags at all. Some servers may not have any flags. This page will briefly describe each flag.

## Good flags

Good super flags provide some additional benefit, such as faster movement, a smaller tank, or different weapons like laser or guided missile.

### Agility (A)

Tank is quick and nimble making it easier to dodge.

### Burrow (BU)

Tank burrows underground, impervious to normal shots, but can be steamrolled by anyone!

### Cloaking (CL)

Makes your tank invisible out-the-window. Still visible on radar.

### Rapid Fire (F)

Shoots more often. Shells go faster but not as far.

### Genocide (G)

Killing one tank kills that tank's whole team.

### Guided Missile (GM)

Shots track a target. Lock on with right button. Can lock on or retarget after firing.

### Invisible Bullet (IB)

Your shots don't appear on other radars. Can still see them out window.

### Identify (ID)

Identifies type of nearest flag.

### Jumping (JP)

Tank can jump. Use Tab key. Can't steer in the air.

### Laser (L)

Shoots a laser. Infinite speed and range but long reload time.

### Machine Gun (MG)

Very fast reload and very short range.

### Masquerade (MQ)

In opponent's hud, you appear as a teammate.

### Narrow (N)

Tank is super thin. Very hard to hit from front but is normal size from side. Can get through small openings.

### Oscillation Overthruster (OO)

Can drive through buildings. Can't back up or shoot while inside.

### Super Bullet (SB)

Shoots through buildings. Can kill Phantom Zone.

### Seer (SE)

Getting hit only drops flag. Flag flies an extra-long time.

### Steamroller (SR)

Destroys tanks you touch but you have to get really close.

### Stealth (ST)

Tank is invisible on radar. Shots are still visible. Sneak up behind enemies!

### Shock Wave (SW)

Firing destroys all tanks nearby. Don't kill teammates! Can kill tanks on/in buildings.

### Tiny (T)

### Thief (TH)

### Wings (WG)

Tank can drive in air.
