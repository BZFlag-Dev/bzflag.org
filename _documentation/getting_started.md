Another benefit is that other players can not use registered callsigns. To register a callsign, visit our [forums](https://forums.bzflag.org) and register an account.

## Game Mechanics

### Teams

The game has four main teams: Red, Green, Blue, and Purple. In the Free For All and Capture The Flag game modes, each of those teams work together to fight the other teams. Teammates should not shoot each other in those modes. In the Open Free For All game mode, the teams do not matter and it is allowed to shoot any tank for points.

There is also a Rogue class that is allowed to shoot any other tank, even other Rogues.

In the Rabbit Chase game mode, team selection does not matter.  The server will automatically set the player's team to either Hunter or Rabbit. 

### Game Modes

#### Free For All (FFA)

#### Open (Teamless) Free For All (OpenFFA)

#### Capture The Flag (CTF)

#### Rabbit Chase

In this mode, a single Rabbit is chosen by the server. All of the other players will be Hunters. The Rabbit has the opportunity to score the most points, but it is also the most vulnerable. When the Rabbit is killed, a new Rabbit is selected by the server.
